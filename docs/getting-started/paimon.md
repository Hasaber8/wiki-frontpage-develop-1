# Paimon Eating

This part will explain how we made Paimon Eating feels more "Yes"

1. Optimized Routines and Libraries
2. Workaround for Unity tendency to always runs at Big and Prime (for devices with Prime CPU)
3. Workaround for another Unity broken stuff like their awful Garbage Collector
4. Fix for inconsistent Vsync that happens in some worlds
